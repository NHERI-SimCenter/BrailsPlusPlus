The Building Regional Asset Inventories at Large Scale (**BRAILS++**) is an object-oriented framework for building applications that focus on generating asset inventories for large geographic regions. The asset inventories generated are intended for those in research and goverment to understand the effects of natural hazards on the communities they impact. It is released as open-source under a BSD-2 licence. 

The Documentaion of BRAILS++ consists mainly of the documenting the frameworks API (generated by sphinx-apidoc) and examples demonstrating how components of the framework can be put together to create applocations.

The initial development of BRAILS++ was done by the NHERI-SimCenter, funded by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 1621843 and No. 2131111.
