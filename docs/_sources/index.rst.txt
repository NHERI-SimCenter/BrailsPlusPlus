The Building Regional Asset Inventories at Large Scale (**BRAILS++**) is an object-oriented framework designed for developing applications that focus in generating asset inventories across large geographic regions. These inventories are intended for those in research and industry to understand the effects of natural hazards on the communities they impact. BRAILS++ is released as open-source under a BSD-3 license.

The Documentaion of BRAILS++ consists mainly of the documenting the frameworks API (generated by sphinx-apidoc) and a series of examples illustrating how its components can be combined to build applications.

The initial development of BRAILS++ was carried out by NHERI-SimCenter, with funding from the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 1621843 and No. 2131111.
