## What is it?

```BRAILS++``` is an object-oriented framework for building applications that focus on generating asset inventories for large geographic regions.

## How is the repo laid out?

#### :building_construction:UNDER CONSTRUCTION!! :building_construction: 

+ ```brails```: A directory containing the classes
  - ```brails/types```: directory containing useful datatypes, e.g., ```ImageSet``` and ```AssetInventory```
  - ```brails/processors```: directory containing classes that do ```image_processing``` to make predictions, e.g. RoofShape
  - ```brails/segmenters```: directory containing classes that do image segmentation.
  - ```brails/scrapers```: directory containing classes that do internet downloads, e.g., footprint scrapers, image scrapers.
  - ```brails/filters```: directory containing image filters, e.g., classes that take images and revise or filter out thiings not needed.
  - ```brails/imputaters```: directory containing classes that fill in missing ```AssetInventory``` datasets, i.e. filling in features that are missing in certain Assets of the AssetInventory.
  - ```brails/inferers```: directory containing classes that infer new asset features based on existing features in the Assets of ```AssetInventory```.
  - ```brails/utils```: directory containing misc classes that do useful things, e.g. geometric conversions
+ ```examples```: A directory containing examples
+ ```tests```: A directory containing unit tests. The directory structure follows that of ```brails```

## Documentation

## Installation instructions

```BRAILS++``` is available on PyPI under the name ```BRAILS```.

```shell
pip install BRAILS
```
