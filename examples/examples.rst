Examples
========

A series of examples is provided as documentation for |app|. These examples are organized progressively, building on concepts introduced in previous examples to deepen understanding step-by-step. Each example presents one or more Python scripts, explaining their inputs and discussing the outputs generated by running the scripts. While the examples focus on key outputs, they represent only a subset of the information produced. Since |app| primarily focuses on creating regional inventories, several links to Jupyter notebooks are included to display interactive maps, providing insights into the larger inventories generated.

   1. The provided notebooks are rather terse. The examples page and the example shown in the page, describe in greater detail what is happening. The notebooks are just for you to play in and explore.

   2. The notebook links bring you to Google **Colab** and other free on-line resources. Some of these resources, may require an account be set-up prior to running the notebook on their servers.
