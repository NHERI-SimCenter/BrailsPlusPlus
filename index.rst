The Building Regional Asset Inventories for Large Scale Simulation (**BRAILS++**) is an object-oriented framework for building applications that focus on generating asset inventories for large geographic regions. The asset inventories generated are intended for those in research and goverment to understand the effects of natural hazards on the communities they impact. It is released as open-source under a BSD-3 licence. 



The Documentaion of BRAILS++ consists mainly of the documenting the frameworks API (generated by sphinx-apidoc) and a series of examples illustrating how its components can be combined to build applications.

The initial development of BRAILS++ was carried out by NHERI-SimCenter, with funding from the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 1621843 and No. 2131111.
