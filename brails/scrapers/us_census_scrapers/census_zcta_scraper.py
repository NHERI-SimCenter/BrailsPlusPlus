    A class for scraping and processing National Bridge Inventory (NBI) data.

    The class handles tasks such as fetching and processing bridge data,
    meshing the region into smaller cells for efficient data retrieval, and
    organizing the results into an AssetInventory.

    Attributes:
        length_unit (str):
            The unit of length (default is 'ft').
        inventory (AssetInventory):
            An inventory object that holds the assets for this instance.

    Methods:
        get_assets(region: RegionBoundary) -> AssetInventory:
            Retrieves bridge inventory data within a given region boundary,
            processes the data, and returns the inventory of assets.

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize an instance of the class with a specified length unit.

        This constructor allows you to specify the length unit through the
        optional `input_dict`. If `input_dict` is not provided, the length
        unit defaults to 'ft' (feet). The inventory is also initialized when
        an instance is created.

        Args:
            input_dict (dict, optional):
                A dictionary that may contain a key 'length' specifying the
                length unit to be used. If 'length' is provided in the
                dictionary, it will be used to set the length unit (the value
                will be converted to lowercase). If the dictionary is not
                provided or if 'length' is not specified, 'ft' (feet) will be
                used as the default length unit.

            region (RegionBoundary):
                A `RegionBoundary` object representing the geographic region
