        A scraper for retrieving and processing National Bridge Inventory data.
    
        This class automates getting bridge data for a region from the NBI, 
        subdividing a region into smaller cells for efficient API calls, 
        filtering the results to include only bridges inside the specified
        region boundary, converting dimensional attributes into preferred 
        units, and organizing the data into an ``AssetInventory``.

                A dictionary mapping measurement types (e.g., length, weight)
                to their preferred output units. Parsed from the optional
                ``input_dict`` argument or defaulted to predefined units.
            inventory (AssetInventory):
                An inventory object that stores all processed bridge assets for

        Initialize an instance of the class with specified units.

        This constructor allows you to specify the length unit through the
        optional `input_dict`. If `input_dict` is not provided, the length
        unit defaults to 'ft' (feet). The inventory is also initialized when
        an instance is created.
