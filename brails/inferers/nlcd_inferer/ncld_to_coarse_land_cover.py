    Convert detailed USGS NLCD classes to a set of coarse categories.

    This class maps USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) classes to one of
    five coarse categories: ``'Open'``, ``'Light Suburban'``, ``'Suburban'``,
    ``'Light Trees'``, or ``'Trees'``.

    It operates exclusively on the ``'land_cover'`` field of each asset in an
    inventory and adds a new field ``'LandCover'`` containing the mapped coarse
    category. Missing or unmapped values are assigned a placeholder
    (default: ``'Unknown'``).

    code:

    .. code-block:: python

        Update each asset in the inventory with a coarse land cover category.

        The method reads the ``'land_cover'`` field of each asset, maps it to a
        coarse category using the provided mapping, and writes the result to
        the ``'coarse_land_cover'`` field. If the original value is missing or
        unmapped, a placeholder is used.
