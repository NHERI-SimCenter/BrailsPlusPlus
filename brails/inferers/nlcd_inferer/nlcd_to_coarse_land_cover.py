    Convert detailed USGS NLCD classes to a set of coarse categories.

    This class maps USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) classes to one of
    five coarse categories: ``'Open'``, ``'Light Suburban'``, ``'Suburban'``,
    ``'Light Trees'``, or ``'Trees'``.

    It operates exclusively on the ``'land_cover'`` field of each asset in an
    inventory and adds a new field ``'LandCover'`` containing the mapped coarse
    category. Missing or unmapped values are assigned a placeholder
    (default: ``'Unknown'``).

    To use :class:`NLCDToCoarseLandCover`, include the following lines in your
    code:

    .. code-block:: python

        from brails import Importer

        importer = Importer()
        nlcd_inferer = importer.get_class(NLCDToCoarseLandCover)

    def infer(self, input_inventory: AssetInventory) -> AssetInventory:
        """
        Update each asset in the inventory with a coarse land cover category.

        The method reads the ``'land_cover'`` field of each asset, maps it to a
        coarse category using the provided mapping, and writes the result to
        the ``'coarse_land_cover'`` field. If the original value is missing or
        unmapped, a placeholder is used.

        Args:
            asset_inventory (AssetInventory):
                An inventory object containing assets with a ``'land_cover'``
                field.
